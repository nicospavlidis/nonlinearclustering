Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction for Clustering


Clusters defined in low dimensional manifolds can have highly nonlinear
structure, which can cause linear dimensionality reduction methods to fail. A
number of established nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods use a graph
representation of the data to define the transformation (embedding) to a low
dimensional space. To the best of our knowledge there is very little work relating
such approaches to the preservation of clusters in the low dimensional 
representation. In this work we employ the Isometric mapping (Isomap) methodology
to investigate conditions under which the separability of clusters defined in
manifolds is guaranteed in the low dimensional representation. Extensive experiments
on both simulated and real data sets provide further evidence on the
wide applicability of the methods.
